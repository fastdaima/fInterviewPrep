- Humans count in decimal 10 system like 0-9, after that rest to 10 and then the 0-9 starts again
- Computers count in binary system, i.e) 0 or 1 
  
## Logarithms
- base 2 signifies how many times should we multiply 2 to get the number or how
  many times it can be divided by 2 
  

## Permutations and factorial 
- set: 
  - unique collection of items
  - order doesn't matter 
- permutations:
	- specific order/arrangement of elements in a set 
- counting permutations: 
  - example calculate permutations of a,b,c
  - for first position you have 3 options, then for second position you have 2
	options for last position you have 1 option.
  - formula: n * n-1 * n-2 ... 1 
  - 5! = 120 means there are 120 ways to arrange 5 letter word 
	
## subsets:
- group of elements from main set A 
- how many subsets can be found in A:
	- it depends upon the number of events.
	- for example: if there is one switch, on or off there are 2 subsets. 
	- formula: 2^n 
	- note: 2^n includes both empty set and whole set.

## Arithmetic Sequence:
- It is a sequence, if the differences between the elements is constant.
- for ex: 1,2,3,4 is a arithmetic because it has difference 1 
- for ex: 1,3,5,7 is a arithmetic because it has difference 2 
- sum of arithmetic sequence:
	- (first element + last element) * number of elements / 2
## geometric sequence:
- it is a sequence of numbers such that ratio between consecutive terms is
  constant
- sum of geometric  sequence:
	- first element * (1 - ratio^number of elements)/(1-ratio)
	- used in counting number of nodes in a binary tree 
	  
## Modular arithmetic:
- x % y
- converting 24 format to 12 hour format: example time is 15 = 15 % 12 = 3 PM.
